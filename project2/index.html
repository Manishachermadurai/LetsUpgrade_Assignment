        <h2>COFEE</h2>
        <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,
            the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. All fruit must be further processed from a raw
            material—the fruit and seed—into a stable, raw product; un-roasted, green coffee. To process the
            berries, the seed is separated from the fruit to produce green coffee. Green coffee is then roasted,
            a process which transforms the raw product (green coffee) into a consumable product (roasted coffee).
            Roasted coffee is ground into a powder and mixed with water to produce a cup of coffee.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
            primarily due to its caffeine content.It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,
            and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte,
            or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is
            common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It
            may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts. A commercial establishment
            that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch
            coffeeshops selling cannabis).</p>
        <h2>What are the 4 types of coffee?</h2>
        <P>There are four primary types of coffee beans we'll be discussing here: Arabica
            (Coffee arabica), Robusta (Coffee caniphora), Liberica (Coffee liberica), and
            Excelsa (Coffee liberica var. dewevrei)</P>
        <p>The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee
            plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the
            Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the
            leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total. Coffee is a major export
            commodity as the leading legal agricultural export for numerous countries.
            It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green,
            unroasted coffee is the most traded agricultural commodity, and the coffee trade is the most
            traded commodity second only to petroleum.Despite the sales of coffee reaching billions of
            dollars, those actually producing the beans are disproportionately living in poverty.
            Critics also point to the coffee industry's negative impact on the environment and the clearing of
            land for coffee-growing and water use. The environmental costs and wage disparity of farmers is
            causing the market for fair trade and organic coffee to expand.</p>

        <h2>Is coffee good for your health?</h2>
        <p>“For most people, moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy diet.” Hu
            said that moderate coffee intake—about 2–5 cups a day—is linked to a lower
            likelihood of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver and endometrial cancers, Parkinson's disease,
            and depression.</p>
        <p>Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial
            as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption
            reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable
            credibility.</p>
